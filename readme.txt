**Action: tootpress_toots_update**  
It will be fired after toot update to execute custom post-processing.  
You can use the following code.

`function tootpress_toots_update_postprocessing() {`
``
`    // Add your code to be executed here`
``
`}`
`add_action('tootpress_toots_update', 'tootpress_toots_update_postprocessing');`

It outputs html content before the toot loop.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why are boosts, replys and private toots not supported? =

Boosts are not your toots. Replys are communication, but not micro-posts. Private Toots should stay private.

= How does TootPress handle the canonical URL? =

TootPress does not modify the existing canonical url handling in WordPress. If you want to create a unique canonical url for each TootPress subpage, you must control that with a SEO plugin. This becomes relevant when your toots must be distributed over several pages and the plugin starts the paging process.

= What have to be considered with the usage of caching plugins? =

The length of the cron period in combination with the configuration of caching determines how early a toot will be displayed within the blog. If a toot should be displayed as early as possible, the caching must be deactivated for the page containing the toots. Another possibility is removing the affected page from the cache, if new toots have been loaded. For this, a WordPress Action is fired by the plugin, which then must be processed by your caching plugin.

= How are backlinks to Mastodon displayed? =

Backlinks to Mastodon can be activated in the plugin settings. In this case, the Mastodon Logo, which is shown for each toot, will be extended with an link to the original toot on the corresponding Mastodon instance. Recommendation is not activating the backlinks as this could cause an negative impact on SEO rating.

= Does TootPress support WordPress Multisite? =

No. TootPress does not support the WordPress Multisite Feature. The plugin is working on the master-site, but is not working on all other child sites within the wordpress network.
